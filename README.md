# Web App with React and Discord Webhook Integration

In this tutorial, we will create a web app using React that sends data to a Discord webhook using the Fetch API. This can be useful for sending notifications, alerts, or updates to a Discord server from your web application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- A Discord server where you have permission to create a webhook.

## Step 1: Set Up a React Project

First, let's set up a new React project using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app discord-webhook-app
cd discord-webhook-app
```
